# Plan for supervised study

## What?

Develop a standardised format for lesson content that employs modern androgogical/pedagogical principles to engage learners of all styles, avoiding the biases of the content author as much as possible. The outcome of this project will be a PDF document describing this format, explaining the choices made in its formulation and the provision of a real world example lesson (from Development Platforms). A presentation aimed at teachers and students will also be included in this work.

Due to the nature of online studies, the theoretical foundation will be on self-directed, humanist, transformative learning - placing the emphasis on a student's self-realisation of knowledge.

Involving students in content creation is a high priority, not only to ensure good feedback, but also as a learning exercise for them. Being involved in the creation of content will help to build a sense of investment and pride, transforming a passive learner into an active contributor. This door has previously been closed and part of this project is to investigate reliable approaches to keeping it open.

## Why?

The aim of this project is to make course content maximally accessible, engaging, enjoyable and consistent for as many learners as possible. This cannot be done by one person alone and involves engagement with the entire community of learning.

Existing lesson content is inconsistent in format and not uniformly written with pedagogical principles in mind. Content could be better designed for non-textual learners, for example through the addition of more video, audio and interactive content. Current content is characterised by the preferences of the content author, including content that I have produced in the past.

As 100% of online students utilise the written content in their studies, the consequences of either very well tailored content or poorly tailored content are considerable. One mistake in one lesson can easily be multiplied by hundreds if it is not corrected - similarly if a lesson invokes the wrong *feeling* in a student this may turn them off or create a mental barrier to learning (I experience this myself). Lesson content structure should carefully consider pre-existing knowledge, the available time budget of students, relationships with evaluation and the intended learning outcomes. (Relational model)

## How?

Before any work on this format can take place, there should be a period of research into online lesson structure. This research will target:

1. Learning styles and how to engage with these
2. Existing written formats (Hattie has a format that I like)
3. Existing audio formats (Automatic transcription?)
4. Existing video formats (What makes an effective video lesson?)
5. Discussion forum with existing students on their experiences

Once data has been gathered, I will seek supervision to validate or further this research.

Next, a provisional template will be designed with a focus on:

1. Layout and structure of written content
2. Approach to video production
3. Approach to audio production
4. Approach to interactive tools
5. How to apply this to existing or new content

Once this format has been produced, I will seek supervision to validate or refine this format.

Next, a sample lesson from Development Platforms will be produced using the format.

I will seek supervision on the application of the format to real content, and if my goals have been met.

Next, the lesson content will be demonstrated to teachers and students - with volunteers from both groups testing out the content and providing their feedback. Feedback will be considered, discussed with the supervisor and amends made as a result.

I will deliver the PDF guide, example lesson content and presentation to finish this project.

## Stages

2. Template Design (4 hours + 2 hours supervision)
3. Content Production (10 hours)
4. Testing & Amends (2 hours + 1 hour supervision)
5. Delivery (1 hour)
